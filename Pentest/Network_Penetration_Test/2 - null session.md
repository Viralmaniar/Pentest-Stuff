- Active Reconnaissance Methods:
  - Null Session:
    - net use \\[DA IP Address]\ipc$ "" "/user:"
    - here we're trying to connect using a blank password and username
    - if you see "the command completed successfully". At this moment we'be made successful connection.
  
  - Confirm Null Session is mapped:
    - net use
    - Now one should see a mapping to the IPC$ share to each computer to which attacker machine is connected
