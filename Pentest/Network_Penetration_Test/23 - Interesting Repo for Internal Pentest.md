- Impacket: Impacket is a collection of Python classes for working with network protocols. Impacket is focused on providing low-level programmatic access to the packets and for some protocols (for instance NMB, SMB1-3 and MS-DCERPC) the protocol implementation itself. Packets can be constructed from scratch, as well as parsed from raw data, and the object oriented API makes it simple to work with deep hierarchies of protocols. The library provides a set of tools as examples of what can be done within the context of this library.
A description of some of the tools can be found at: http://corelabs.coresecurity.com/index.php?module=Wiki&action=view&type=tool&name=Impacket

- pywerview: As a pentester, I love using PowerView during my assignments. It makes it so easy to find vulnerable machines, or list what domain users were added to the local Administrators group of a machine, and much more.

However, running PowerView on a computer which is not connected to the domain is a pain: I always find myself using mimikatz's sekurlsa::pth to run a Powershell prompt with stolen domain credentials, and that's not easy to script. Plus, I'm a Linux guy and I've always found it a shame that there were no complete Windows/Active Directory enumeration tool on Linux.

That's why I decided to rewrite some of PowerView's functionalities in Python, using the wonderful impacket library.

Update: I haven't tested the last version of PowerView yet, which can run from a machine not connected to a domain. I don't know if it works correctly under Linux using Powershell. If anyone has had any experience with this at all, you can contact me, I'm really interested. We'll see if pywerview has become obsoleted ;) but I think I'll continue working on it eitherway: I'd still rather use Python than Powershell on Linux, and I'm learning a lot! Plus, it may integrated in existing Linux tools written in Python. It's still great news that PowerView now supports machines not connected to the domain!
