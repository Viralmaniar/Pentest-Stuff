- How transactions are managed on a blockchain?
  - Transactions are grouped in units
  - units are nothing but blocks
  - first block is known as Genesis block. Always starts with block 0.
  - There are other properties of the transactions which gets stored on the block:
    - timestamp
    - hash values of the data on the block
    - each time the data get appended to the block hash of the block gets changed. Basically creating hash of the block using simple hashing algorithms. 
    - PrviousBlockHash property is the most important concept to create a chain.
    - each block in the chain stores the hash value of the previous block. Hence creating the chain.
