<p>Step 1: Sit back and Relax <br>
Step 2: Close your eyes <br>
Step 3: Rewind your day, last week or journey of your life</p>

<p>Just look at yourself.</p>

<p>The journey of my life- my work, my relationships, my family, my friends, my social responsibilities. As I play my every roles, fulfil my every responsibility perform y every karma. Let me look at my state of being. </p>

<p>How I feel?</p>

<p>What is it?</p>

<p>Who is it? </p>

<p>That disturbs my state of mind. I am peaceful, calm, relaxed and very happy. And then what is it that shifts me from my originality?</p>

<p>What is it that causes me to create slight irritation, aggression and even haterate sometimes. - Hurt, fear, rejection, jealousy non of these motions look me feel nice. But, what is it that causes me to feel this? </p>

<p>I want to be happy and I want to be happy always. </p>

<p>Do I have a choice? </p>

<p>What is it that shifts me from my state of stability, happiness and peace?</p>

<p>Let me just check today, half the day pass. What was the reason, what was the situation that stimulus and caused my mind to shift?</p>
