<p>Date - <b><i>20th of January 2016</i></b></p>

<p>I am very new to malware hunting and this area seems very interesting to me. As this involves finding the real motive behind an attack. Few of the methods in the malware hunting using Sysinternals tools is very much important while performing thick application testing.</p>

<p><font size="8" color="red">Tools of the Trade:</font></p>

<ul>
<li>Process Explorer</li>
<li>Sigcheck</li>
<li>Autoruns</li>
<li>Process Monitor</li>
</ul>

<p>Download the latest version from - <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb545021.aspx">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb545021.aspx</a></p>

<p><font size="8" color="red">Color Coding in Process Explorer:</font></p>

<ul>
<li><font size="4" color="pink">Pink - </font> This processes are system processes.</li>
<li><font size="4" color="blue">Blue - </font> This processes are user processes. </li>
<li><font size="4" color="purple">Purple - </font> This processes are the packed binary. Possibly encrypted processes. Look more into such process (Quick win)</li>
<li><font size="4" color="Red">Red - </font> This processes are the terminating processes and exiting the CPU.</li>
<li><font size="4" color="Green">Green - </font> This processes are recently opened or started by the user/system.</li>
</ul>

<p><font size="8" color="red">Things to look using Process Explorer:</font></p>

<ul>
<li>‘Description’ and ‘Company Name’ are very important fields. Most of the malware doesn’t have anything in these fields. <i>However, a good malware developer will put fake information in these fields to look more legit. </i></li>
<li></li>
</ul>

<p>Yay!!!! I am happy!!!!! :)</p>
