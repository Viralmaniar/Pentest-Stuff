<p>Challenge: How to intercept 4G/3G traffic using burp proxy?</p>

<p>Issue: The mobile application I was testing only accepts mobile data to communicate with the server. Application detects Wifi connection and pops up a message denying the access to communicate further.</p>

<p><font size="8" color="red">Set-up:</font></p>

<ul>
<li>Putty: <br>
<ul><li>Port-forwarding local port to remote port (External IP)</li>
<li>Create remote tunnel with source port and destination IP address</li>
<li>Start SSH session internal IP address (firewall) and name the session. Save this session for future use. With Load button once can load old sessions.</li></ul></li>
<li>Burp proxy (Listening on all interface) - port number would be the one forwarded from local to remote</li>
<li>start nc listener on external port (connect from external IP on that port and look for traffic)</li>
<li>On mobile go to settings–&gt;More networks–&gt;Mobile networks–&gt;Access Point Names</li>
<li>From the list of APNs select the appropriate APN and set-up a proxy IP (External IP address) and Port (Remote port)</li>
</ul>

<p>Once this is done access the application using mobile data and see the traffic through Burp! :-)</p>

<p>Very happy to learn this with the help of my colleague!!!</p>
