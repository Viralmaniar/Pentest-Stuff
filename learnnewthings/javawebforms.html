<p>Recently I was testing a web application which was bit different then our normal web application. After spending some time on an engagement and understanding the whole application I got to know that application is using something called Java Web Forms.</p>

<p>This is exciting, I have never came across such type of application. It was the first time I have heard of this sort of an application. The challenge was to inspect the web application traffic through standard proxy (In my case I was using Burp).</p>

<p>Possible Vulnerablities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Deserialize java objects</li>
<li>Header injection</li>
</ul>
