<p>Date - <b><i>2nd of January 2016</i></b></p>

<p>Recently I was testing a web application which was bit different then our normal web application. After spending some time on an engagement and understanding the whole application I got to know that application is using something called Java Web Forms.</p>

<p>This is exciting, I have never came across such type of application. It was the first time I have heard of this sort of an application. The challenge was to inspect the web application traffic through standard proxy (In my case I was using Burp).</p>
