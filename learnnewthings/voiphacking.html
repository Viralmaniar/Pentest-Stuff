<p>Date - <b><i>3rd of January 2016</i></b></p>

<p>I always wanted to spoof calls and see if I can pretend to be someone and and looking at other people first reaction. <b>Scenario:</b> I spoofed my aunt number and called my uncle to see his reaction.

<li>Kali-OS</li>
<li>Softphone: It is a program for making telephone calls over the Internet</li>
<li>To fake calls: Both parties in the scenario must support the same protocol (VoIP/SIP) or atleast  once common audio codec.</li>
<li>Metaspolit</li>
